# Goal

The goal of this project was to better understand the sequence assembly problem. To do this, I took a series of DNA reads and connected them to form a sequence. If the reads had a prefix-suffix overlap longer than 50 characters, then they are assumed to be connected. 

Within a notebook, I implemented an algorithm that takes in a sequence of fragmented reads and assembles the sequence.
