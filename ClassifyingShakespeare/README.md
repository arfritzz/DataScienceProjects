# Purpose

The goal of this project was two fold. 

First, I needed to perform feature engineering to introduce additional value to the data. This analysis was performed in the word trimming notebook.

Second, I built two classification models to classify players. The first model I build used Random Forest to predict what player was saying a line based on the play, act, scene, and polarity of the line. I trained the model with 68% accuracy. Secondly, I used the decision tree classiier to predict the player again based on the play, act, scene, and polarity of the line. This resulted in a 70% accuracy.
