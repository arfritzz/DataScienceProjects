In this project, I analyzed MNIST data using a Convolution Neural Network. CNNs are best for image classifcation so that is why I choose the MNIST dataset. 

I created two models where the first model was the minimum amount of layers in a CNN. The accuracy was 98%. 

I then created another model with more layers to see if that would improve the accuracy. It did. the accuracy for this second model was 99%.
